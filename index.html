        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>My educational journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in both theoretical knowledge and practical skills across various domains of forestry and landscape ecology. Commencing with a Bachelor of Science in Forestry from Tribhuvan University, Nepal, I delved into subjects such as Forest Management, Silviculture, Forest Economics, and Wildlife Biology, among others. Building upon this groundwork, I pursued a Master of Science in Landscape Ecology and Nature Conservation at the University of Greifswald, Germany, supported by a prestigious DAAD Scholarship Award. During this period, I deepened my understanding of principles in Landscape Ecology, Vegetation Ecology, Nature Conservation Economics, and Experimental Plant Ecology, among other subjects.</p>

        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <p>With a solid academic background in Landscape Ecology and Nature Conservation from Greifswald University, I joined the Forest Research and Training Center (FRTC) as an Assistant Research Officer, initially focusing on the Forest Survey and Carbon Monitoring Section. Here, I played a pivotal role in designing and implementing a comprehensive national forest inventory, and conducted forest data analysis, carbon density assessments and mapping. Additionally, my responsibilities were over time encompassing advanced skills related to calculating emission factors, drafting emission reduction reports, and actively participating in initiatives like the LEAF Program. Currently, as a Research Officer in the Climate Change Management Division at the Ministry of Forest and Environment, I am deeply involved in preparing and submitting national reports on greenhouse gas emissions, as well as mobilizing resources for climate change-related programs.</p>
